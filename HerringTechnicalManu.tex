\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) uses simulation to evaluate the
trade-offs resulting from alternative management options in the face of
uncertainty (Punt et al. 2016). MSEs require time, however, for
stakeholder input, data collection, and model development (Butterworth
2007) (Punt et al., 2014). As such, the process can take much longer
than ``traditional'' management time frames (Butterworth 2007) . The
development time is also likely to lengthen when explicit ecosystem,
multi-species, or socioeconomic considerations are desired because the
data and modeling needs, and subsequent uncertainties, are all greater
than in a single species approach. This manuscript chronicles the
development of an MSE done on a truncated timetable (\textasciitilde{}12
months) required to meet management time frames.

In January 2016, the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC), the
political body responsible for federally managed species in the
northeast US, approved the conduct of an MSE to evaluate harvest control
rules (HCRs) for Atlantic herring (hereafter herring) \emph{Clupea
harengus}. The primary goal of this MSE was to evaluate the effects of
alternative HCRs on the herring fishery, predators of herring, and the
human environment. The MSE was also to include a public stakeholder
process. The NEFMC desired to have results from the MSE ready to inform
fisheries management decisions within one year, which left little time
to develop the technical aspects of the MSE, especially in the context
of multiple public stakeholder workshops. A particularly challenging
aspect of the time frame was deciding what technical aspects of the MSE
(e.g., operating models) could be compromised (i.e., perhaps not ideal
from a scientific or best-practices standpoint) while ensuring the
results would still accurately portray the trade-offs among objectives
and remain relevant for decision-making. The objectives of this
manuscript were to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Evaluate the relative performance of HCRs at meeting herring fishery
  objectives, including those related to predators of herring, as
  informed by stakeholder input, and,
\item
  Discuss our approach to developing an MSE on a relatively truncated
  timetable in order to meet management time frames, and identify the
  lessons learned throughout the process, especially as they relate to
  using MSE as a tool to advance an ecosystem based approach to
  management (Plag√°nyi et al. 2014).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\textbf{Herring}

\emph{Basics.--} An MSE was developed specific to Gulf of Maine -
Georges Bank Atlantic herring. The MSE was a modified version of that
used in Deroba et al. (2015), and symbols were largely consistent with
Deroba et al. (2015) (Table 1). The MSE was based on an age-structured
simulation that considered fish from age-1 through age-8+ (age-8 and
older), which is consistent with the age ranges used in the 2012 and
2015 Atlantic herring stock assessments (NOAA National Marine Fisheries
Service 2012, Deroba et al. 2015). The abundances at age in year one of
all simulations equaled the equilibrium abundances produced by the
fishing mortality rate that would reduce the population to 40\% of
\(SSB_{F=0}\). Abundance in each subsequent age and year was calculated
assuming that fish died exponentially according to an age and year
specific total instantaneous mortality rate (Table XX T1-T2).

Recruitment followed Beverton-Holt dynamics (Francis 1992) (Table XX
T3-T5). The variance of recruitment process errors (\(\sigma_R^2\))
equaled 0.36 and the degree of autocorrelation (\(\omega\)) equaled 0.1,
which are values consistent with recruitment estimates from a recent
Atlantic herring stock assessment (Deroba et al. 2015).

\emph{Assessment Error.--} A stock assessment was approximated (i.e.,
assessment errors) similar to Punt et al. (2008) and Deroba et al.
(2015). Assessment error was modeled as a year-specific lognormal random
deviation common to all ages, with first-order autocorrelation and a
term that created the option to include bias (Table XX T6-T7). The
variance of assessment errors (\(\sigma_\phi^2\) ) equaled 0.05 and
autocorrelation (\(\vartheta\)) equaled 0.7. Rho (\(\rho\)) allowed for
the inclusion of bias in the assessed value of abundance (see below;
Deroba 2014). Assessed spawning stock biomass (\(\widehat{SSB}_y\)) was
calculated similarly to \(SSB_y\) except with \(N_{a,y}\) replaced with
\(\widehat{N}_{a,y}\) (Table XX T5), and assessed total biomass
(\(\widehat{B}_y\)) was calculated as the sum across ages of the product
of \(\widehat{N}_{a,y}\) and \(W_a\).

\emph{Operating Models.--} The stakeholder workshops identified
uncertainties about herring life history traits and stock assessment,
and the effect of some of these uncertainties on harvest control rule
performance was evaluated by simulating the control rules for each of
eight operating models (Table 2; Figures 1-2). The uncertainties
addressed by the eight operating models included: Atlantic herring
natural mortality and recruitment , Atlantic herring weight-at-age, and
possible bias in the stock assessment beyond the unbiased measurement
error (\(\epsilon_{\phi y}\)).

The specific values used in the operating models for each of the
uncertainties were premised on data used in recent stock assessments or
estimates from fits of stock assessment models (NOAA National Marine
Fisheries Service 2015). Natural mortality in recent stock assessments
has varied among ages and years, with \(M\) being higher during
1996-2014 than in previous years (NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service
2012, 2015). Natural mortality, however, has also been identified as an
uncertainty in the stock assessments and sensitivity runs have been
conducted without higher \(M\) during 1996-2014, such that \(M\) was
constant among years (NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service 2012,
2015). To capture uncertainty in \(M\) in the MSE, operating models were
run with either relatively high or low \(M_a\) (Table 2; Figure 1).
Relatively high \(M_a\) values equaled the age-specific natural
mortality rates used for the years 1996-2014 in the stock assessment.
Relatively low \(M_a\) values in the MSE equaled the age-specific
natural mortality rates used for the years 1965-1995 in the stock
assessment. In the MSE, \(M_a\) was always time invariant.

Uncertainty in estimates of stock-recruit parameters were represented in
the MSE by using the parameters estimated by stock assessments fit with
and without the higher \(M\) during 1996-2014. Stock assessment fits
with higher \(M\) during 1996-2014 produced estimates of steepness and
\(SSB_{F=0}\) that were lower than in stock assessment fits without
higher \(M\) during 1996-2014 (Table 3; Figure 1). Thus, operating
models with relatively high \(M_a\) always had relatively low steepness
and \(SSB_{F=0}\), and the opposite held with relatively low \(M_a\)
(Table 2).

Uncertainty in Atlantic herring size-at-age was accounted for by having
operating models with either fast or slow growth (i.e., weights-at-age;
Table 2; Figure 3). Atlantic herring weight-at-age generally declined
from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, and has been relatively stable
since. Reasons for the decline are speculative and no causal
relationships have been established. Thus, fast growth operating models
had weights-at-age that equaled the January 1 weights-at-age from the
most recent stock assessment averaged over the years 1976-1985, while
the slow growth operating models averaged over the years 2005-2014
(Deroba 2015). In the MSE, weight-at-age was always time invariant.
Differences in \(M\), stock-recruit parameters, and weights-at-age led
to differences in unfished and \(MSY\) reference points among operating
models (Table 3). The effect of \(M\) and stock-recruit parameters was
larger than the effect of differences in weight-at-age (Table 3).

To address concerns about possible stock assessment bias, operating
models with and without a positive bias were included. In operating
models without bias, \(\rho\)=0 and the only assessment error was that
caused by the unbiased measurement errors (\(\epsilon_{\phi y}\)). In
operating models with bias, \(\rho\)=0.6, which was based on the degree
of retrospective pattern in \(SSB\) from the most recent stock
assessment (NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service 2015).

\emph{Harvest Control Rules.--} Several basic control rules were
evaluated, including a biomass based control rule (Katsukawa 2004), a
constant catch rule, and a conditional constant catch rule (Figure 3;
Clark and Hare (2004), Deroba and Bence (2012)). The biomass based
control rule was defined by three parameters: the proportion (\(\psi\))
of \(F_{MSY}\) that dictates the maximum desired fishing mortality rate
(\(\tilde{F}\)), an upper SSB threshold (\(SSB_{up}\)), and a lower SSB
threshold (\(SSB_{low}\)). The \(\tilde{F}\) equaled the maximum when
\(\widehat{SSB}\) was above the upper threshold, declined linearly
between the upper and lower thresholds, and equaled zero below the lower
threshold:

\begin{equation}
  \label{Fy_equation}
    \tilde{F}_y=
    \begin{cases}
      \psi F_{MSY}, & \text{if}\ \widehat{SSB}_y \geq SSB_{up} \\
      \psi F_{MSY} \frac{\widehat{SSB}_y - SSB_{low}}{SSB_{up}-SSB_{low}}, & SSB_{low} < \widehat{SSB}_y < SSB_{up}\\
      0, & if \widehat{SSB}_y \leq SSB_{low}
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}

The \(\tilde{F}_y\) was then used to set a quota in year y + 1 (Table XX
T8). \(\tilde{F}_{ay}\) equaled \(\tilde{F}_y\) times \(S_a\), and
\(S_a\) was time and simulation invariant selectivity at age equal to
the values for the mobile gear fishery reported in (NOAA National Marine
Fisheries Service 2015, Table 1). \(\tilde{F}_y\) was used to set a
quota in the following year to approximate the practice of using
projections based on an assessment using data through year y - 1 to set
quotas in the following year(s). Furthermore, although \(\tilde{F}_y\)
was set using \(\widehat{SSB}_y\), the quota was based on
\(\widehat{B}_y\) because the fishery selects some immature ages. The
fully selected fishing mortality rate that would remove the quota from
the true population (\(\bar{F}_y\)) was found using Newton-Raphson
iterations. Several variations of the biomass based rule were also
evaluated. These variations included applying the control rule annually,
using the same quota for three year blocks such that the control rule is
applied every fourth year (i.e., \(Q_{y+1}=Q_{y+2}=Q_{y+3}\)), using the
same quota for 5 year blocks, and using the same quota for three year
blocks but restricting the change in the quota to 15\% in either
direction when the control rule was reapplied in the fourth year. Thus,
four variants of the biomass based control rule were evaluated: 1)
annual application, 2) three year blocks, 3) five year blocks, and 4) 3
year blocks with a 15\% restriction.

For each biomass based control rule variant, a range of values for the
three parameters defining the control rule were evaluated. The
proportion (\(\psi\)) of \(F_{MSY}\) that dictates the maximum desired
fishing mortality rate was varied from 0.1\(F_{MSY}\) to 1.0\(F_{MSY}\)
in increments of 0.1, while the upper and lower SSB threshold parameters
(\(SSB_{up} \; SSB_{low}\)) were varied from 0.0\(SSB_{MSY}\) to
4\(SSB_{MSY}\) but with inconsistent increments (i.e., 0.0, 0.1, 0.3,
0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4). The full
factorial of combinations for the three biomass based control rule
parameters produced 1,360 shapes (note \(SSB_{low}\) must be
\textless{}= \(SSB_{up}\)) and each of these shapes was evaluated for
each of the four biomass based control rule variants described above.

The constant catch control rule is defined by one parameter, a desired
constant catch (i.e., quota) amount (Figure 3). The constant catch
amounts were varied from 0.1\(MSY\) to 1.0\(MSY\) in increments of 0.1.

The conditional constant catch rule used a constant desired catch amount
unless removing that desired catch from the assessed biomass caused the
fully selected fishing mortality rate to exceed a pre-determined
maximum, in which case the desired catch was set to the value produced
by applying the maximum fully selected fishing mortality rate to the
assessed biomass (Figure 3). Thus, the conditional constant catch rule
has two policy parameters: a desired constant catch amount, and a
maximum fishing mortality rate. The constant catch amounts were varied
from 0.1\(MSY\) to 1.0\(MSY\) in increments of 0.1, while the maximum
fishing mortality rate equaled 0.5\(F_{MSY}\). When the maximum fishing
mortality rate portion the conditional constant catch rule was invoked,
a quota was set in the same manner as when
\(\widehat{SSB}_y >= SSB_{up}\) in the biomass based control rule
described above.

\emph{Implementation Error.--} Implementation errors were also included
in a similar way as in Punt et al. (2008) and Deroba and Bence (2012),
as year-specific lognormal random deviations (Table XX T9). The variance
of implementation errors (\(\sigma_\theta^2\)) equaled 0.001.

\textbf{Predators}

There are two components of predator modeling for the herring MSE: a
predator population model, and a herring-predator relationship model to
link herring with predator populations. Here, we give an overview of the
modeling process, and we describe the decisions made in parameterizing
individual predator models and herring-predator relationships in the
following sections. The overall population in numbers for each predator
each year \(N_{y}\) is modeled with a delay-difference function:

\begin{equation}
N_{y+1} = N_{y}S_{y} +  R_{y+1} \label{delaydiffN_equation},
\end{equation}

where annual predator survival \(S_{y}\) is based on annual natural
mortality \(v\) and exploitation \(u\)

\begin{equation}
S_{y} =  (1-v_{y})(1-u) \label{survival_equation},
\end{equation}

and annual recruitment \(R_{y}\) (delayed until recruitment age a) is a
Beverton-Holt function:

\begin{equation}
R_{y+a} = \frac{\alpha B_{y}}{\beta + B_{y}} \label{delaydiffrec_equation}.
\end{equation}

Predator recruitment parameters are defined with steepness = \(h\),
unfished recruitment \(R_{F=0}\), and unfished spawning biomass
\(B_{F=0}\) as

\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{4hR_{F=0}}{5h-1} \label{predalpha_equation}, and
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta = \frac{(B_{F=0}/R_{F=0})((1-h)/(4h))}{(5h-1)/(4hR_{F=0})} \label{predbeta_equation}
\end{equation}

.

Predator population biomass is defined with Ford-Walford plot intercept
(\(FWint\)) and slope (\(FWslope\)) growth parameters

\begin{equation}
B_{y+1} = S_{y} (FWint N_{y} + FWslope B_{y}) + FWint R_{y+1} \label{delaydiffB_equation}
\end{equation}

Parameterizing this model requires specification of the
stock-recruitment relationship (steepness h and unfished spawning stock
size in numbers or biomass), the natural mortality rate, the fishing
mortality (exploitation) rate, the initial population size, and the
weight at age of the predator (Ford-Walford plot intercept and slope
parameters). For each predator, population parameters were derived from
different sources (Tab. 1).

\end{longtable}

Predator population models were based on either the most recent stock
assessment for the predator or from observational data from the
Northeast US shelf. Herring-predator relationships were based on either
peer-reviewed literature or observational data specific to the Northeast
US shelf. We did not include process or observation error in any of
these modeled relationships. This is obviously unrealistic, but the
primary obective of the herring MSE is to evaluate the effect of herring
management on predators. Leaving out variability driven by anything
other than herring is intended to clarify the effect of herring
managment.

To develop the herring-predator relationship model, specific herring
population characteristics (e.g.~total abundance or biomass, or
abundance/biomass of certain ages or sizes) were related to either
predator growth, predator reproduction, or predator survival. Our aim
was to use information specific to the Northeast US shelf ecosystem,
either from peer-reviewed literature, from observations, or a
combination.

In general, if support for a relationship between herring and predator
recruitment was evident, it was modeled as a predator recruitment
multiplier based on the herring population (\(Hpop_{y}\)) relative to a
specified threshold \(Hthresh\):

\begin{equation}
R_{y+a} = \frac{\alpha B_{y}}{\beta + B_{y}} * \frac{\gamma(Hpop_{y}/Hthresh)}{(\gamma-1)+(Hpop_{y}/Hthresh)} \label{recwithherring_equation}, 
\end{equation}

where \(\gamma\) \textgreater{} 1 links herring population size relative
to the threshold level to predator recruitment.

If a relationship between predator growth and herring population size
was evident, annual changes in growth were modeled by modifying either
the Ford-Walford intercept (\(AnnAlpha\)) or slope (\(AnnRho\)):

\begin{equation}
B_{y+1} = S_{y} (AnnAlpha_{y} N_{y} + FWslope B_{y}) + AnnAlpha_{y}R_{y+1} \label{delaydiffB_equation}, or
\end{equation}\begin{equation}
B_{y+1} = S_{y} (FWint N_{y} + AnnRho_{y} B_{y}) + FWint R_{y+1} \label{delaydiffB_equation}.
\end{equation}

Finally, herring population size \(Hpop_{y}\) could be related to
predator survival using a multiplier on constant predator annual natural
mortality \(v\):

\begin{equation}
v_{y} =  v e ^ {-(\frac{Hpop_{y}}{Hpop_{F=0}})\delta} \label{varmort_equation},
\end{equation}

where 0 \textless{} \(\delta\) \textless{}1 links herring population
size to predator survival.

After specifying the population model parameters and herring-predator
relationship, we applied the (Hilborn and Walters 2003) equilibruim
calculation for the delay difference model with F=0 to get the unfished
spawners per recruit ratio. This ratio was then used in a new
equilibruim calculation with the current predator exploitation rate to
estimate Beverton-Holt stock recruitment parameters, equilibrium
recruitment and equilibrium individual weight under exploitation. Then,
each model was run forward for 150 years with output from the herring
operating model specifying the herring population characteristics.

\subsection{Highly migratory species}\label{highly-migratory-species}

Bluefin tuna were identified at the stakeholder workshop as the
recommended highly migratory herring predator.

\subsubsection{Tuna population model}\label{tuna-population-model}

Western Atlantic bluefin tuna population parameters were drawn from the
2014 stock assessment (ICCAT 2015), the growth curve from (Restrepo et
al. 2010), and recruitment parameters from a detailed examination of
alternative stock recruit relationships (Porch and Lauretta 2016).
Ultimately, the √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬úlow recruitment√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ù scenario was selected to
represent bluefin tuna productivity in the Gulf of Maine, which defines
Bmsy as 13,226 t and therefore affects measures of status relative to
Bmsy. Continuation of the current tuna fishing strategy
(F\textless{}0.5Fmsy under the low recruitment scenario) is assumed. All
predator population model parameters are listed in Table 2.

\subsubsection{Herring-tuna relationship
model}\label{herring-tuna-relationship-model}

Tuna diets are variable depending on location and timing of foraging
(Chase 2002, Golet et al. 2013, 2015, Logan et al. 2015), but for the
purposes of this analysis, we assumed that herring is an important
enough prey of tuna to impact tuna growth in the Northeast US shelf
ecosystem. A relationship between bluefin tuna growth and herring
average weight was implemented based on information and methods in Golet
et al. (2015). The relationship between tuna condition anomaly (defined
as proportional departures from the weight-at-length relationship used
in the assessment) and average weight of tuna-prey-sized herring
(\(Havgwt_{y}\), herring \textgreater{}180 mm collected from commercial
herring fisheries) was modeled as a generalized logistic function with
lower and upper bounds on tuna growth parameters:

\begin{equation}
AnnAlpha_{y} = (0.9 FWint) + \frac{(1.1 FWint) - (0.9 FWint)}{1+e^{(1-\lambda)*(100(Havgwt_{y}-T)/T)}} \label{tunagrow_equation},
\end{equation}

where \(\lambda\) \textgreater{} 1 links herring average weight
anomalies to tuna growth.

The inflection point of \(T\) = 0.15 kg average weight matches the 0
tuna weight anomaly in Golet et al. (2015) (p.~186, Fig 2C), and upper
and lower bounds were determined by estimating the growth intercept with
weight at age 10\% higher or lower, respectively from the average weight
at age obtained by applying the length to weight conversion reported in
the 2014 stock assessment (ICCAT 2015) to the length at age estimated
from the Restrepo et al. (2010) growth curve (Fig \ref{herringtuna}).
When included in the model with \(\lambda\) = 1.1 in equation
\ref{tunagrow_equation}, the simulated variation in tuna weight at age
covered the observed range reported in Golet et al. (2015).

\subsection{Seabirds}\label{seabirds}

Common terns were identified at the stakeholder workshop as the
recommended seabird herring predator.

\subsubsection{Tern population model}\label{tern-population-model}

There is no published stock assessment or population model for most
seabirds in the Northeast US. Therefore, Gulf of Maine Common and Arctic
tern population parameters were drawn from accounts in the Birds of
North America (Hatch 2002, Nisbet 2002) and estimated from counts of
breeding pairs and estimates of fledgling success summarized by the Gulf
of Maine Seabird Working Group (GOMSWG; data at
\url{http://gomswg.org/minutes.html}), as corrected and updated by
seabird experts from throughout Maine. While we analyzed both Arctic and
Common tern information, the stakeholder workshop identified Common
terns as the example species for modeling, and this species has more
extensive data and a generally higher proportion of herring in its diet
based on that data. Therefore, the model is based on common terns in the
Gulf of Maine.

Adult breeding pairs by colony were combined with estimated productivity
of fledglings per nest to estimate the annual number of fledglings for
each year. A survival rate of 10\% was applied to fledglings from each
year to represent √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬úrecruits√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ù to the breeding adult population
age 4 and up (Nisbet 2002). This √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ústock-recruit√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ù information
was used to estimate steepness for the delay difference model based on
common tern information only. Fitting parameters with R nls (R Core Team
2016) had variable success, with the full dataset unable to estimate a
significant beta parameter (cyan line, Fig. \ref{ternSR}) for common
terns, and a truncated dataset resulting in low population production
rates inconsistent with currently observed common tern trends (bright
green line overlaid with black, Fig. \ref{ternSR}). Therefore, steepness
was estimated to give a relationship (black line, Fig. \ref{ternSR})
falling between these two lines. The resulting stock recruit
relationship set steepness at 0.26, a theoretical maximum breeding adult
population of 45,000 pairs (Nisbet (2002), 1930√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ôs New England
population), and a theoretical maximum recruitment of 4,500 individuals
annually (reflecting approximately a productivity of 1.0 at
√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬úcarrying capacity√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ù resulting in a stable population). Average
common tern productivity is 1.02 (all GOM colony data combined). Adult
mortality was assumed to be 0.1 for the delay difference model (survival
of 90\% (Nisbet 2002) for adults).

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{Stock-recruitment function for Gulf of Maine common terns \label{ternSR}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}
\end{figure}

The resulting model based on common tern population dynamics in the Gulf
of Maine (with no link to herring) predicts that the population will
increase to its carrying capacity under steady conditions over a 150
year simulation. The actual population has increased at
\textasciitilde{}2\% per year between 1998 and 2015 (Fig.
\ref{terntrend}). Given the lack of detailed demographic information in
the delay-difference model, this was considered a good representation of
the average observed trend in current common tern population dynamics.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Herring-tern relationship
model}\label{herring-tern-relationship-model}

The relationship between herring abundance and tern reproductive success
was built based on information from individual colonies on annual
productivity, proportion of herring in the diet, and amount of herring
in the population as estimated by the current stock assessment. Since
little of this information has appeared in the peer-reviewed literature,
we present it in detail here. First, productivity information was
evaluated by major diet item recorded for chicks over all colonies and
years. In general, common tern productivity was higher when a
streamlined fish species was the major diet item relative to
invertebrates, but having herring as the major diet item resulted in
about the same distribution of productivities as having hake or
sandlance as the major diet item for these colonies (Fig.
\ref{chickdiet}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=400pt]{HerringTechnicalManu_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1} 

}

\caption{Major diet items for Gulf of Maine tern fledgelings \label{chickdiet}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-4}
\end{figure}

Individual colonies showed different trends in number of nesting pairs,
productivity, and proportion of herring in the diet (plots available
upon request). When both Arctic and Common terns shared a colony,
interannual changes in productivity were generally similar between
species, suggesting that conditions at and around the colony (weather,
predation pressure, and prey fields) strongly influenced productivity
rather than species-specific traits. Only two colonies (Machias Seal
Island near the Canadian Border and Stratton Island in southern Maine)
showed a significant positive correlation between the proportion of
herring in the chick diet and productivity. Other islands showed either
non-significant (no) relationships, or in one case (Metinic Island) a
significant negative relationship (Fig. \ref{proddiet}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=400pt]{HerringTechnicalManu_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1} 

}

\caption{Herring proporiton in diet and tern productivity by colony \label{proddiet}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-5}
\end{figure}

The estimated population size of herring on the Northeast US shelf had
some relationship to the amount of herring in tern diet at several
colonies (4 of 13 common tern colony diets related to herring Age 1
recruitment, 6 of 13 common tern colony diets related to herring total
B, and 4 of 13 common tern colony diets related to herring SSB; detailed
statistics and plots available upon request). However, statistically
significant direct relationships between herring population size and
tern productivity were rare, with only Ship Island productivity
increasing with herring total B, and Eastern Egg Rock, Matinicus Rock,
Ship, and Monomoy Islands productivity increasing with herring SSB.
Given that Monomoy Island tern chicks consistently received the lowest
proportion of herring in their diets of any colony (0-11\%), we
don√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ôt consider this relationship further to build the model.

Based on tern feeding observations, we would expect the number of age 1
herring in the population to be most related to tern productivity since
that is the size class terns target, but this relationship was not found
in analyzing the data. Herring total biomass was positively related to
tern diets at nearly half of the colonies, and reflects all size classes
including the smaller sizes most useful as tern forage, but was only
directly related to tern productivity at one colony. Herring SSB was not
considered further as an index of tern prey because it represents sizes
larger than tern forage.

To represent the potential for herring to influence tern productivity,
we parameterized a tern √É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬úrecruitment multiplier√É¬¢√Ç¬Ä√Ç¬ù based on
herring assessed total biomass and common tern productivity across all
colonies (except Monomoy where terns eat sandlance). This relationship
includes a threshold herring biomass where common tern productivity
would drop below 1.0, and above that threshold productivity exceeds 1.0
(Fig. \ref{herrternmod}). The threshold of \textasciitilde{}400,000 tons
is set where a linear relationship between herring total biomass and
common tern productivity crosses productivity=1 (black dashed line in
Fig. \ref{herrternmod}). However, the selected threshold is uncertain
because there are few observations of common tern productivity at low
herring total biomass (1975-1985). The linear relationship does not have
a statistically significant slope; a curve was fit to represent a level
contribution of herring total biomass to common tern productivity above
the threshold. The curve descends below the threshold, dropping below
0.5 productivity at around 50,000 tons and representing the extreme
assumption that herring extinction would result in tern productivity of
0. Although the relationship of tern productivity to herring biomass at
extremely low herring populations has not been quantified, control rules
that allow herring extinction do not meet stated management objectives
for herring, so this extreme assumption for terns will not change any
decisions to include or exclude control rules.

\caption{Modeled influence of herring total biomass on tern reproductive success \label{herrternmod}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-6}
\end{figure}

When included in the model using \(\gamma\) = 1.09 in equation
\ref{recwithherring_equation}, this relationship adjusts the modeled
common tern population increase to match the current average increase in
common tern nesting pairs observed in the data (Fig.
\ref{terntrendwherring}). There is still considerable uncertainty around
this mean population trajectory which cannot be reflected in our simple
model.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Groundfish}\label{groundfish}

Because no specific groundfish was identified as a representative
herring predator during the stakeholder workshop, the first decision was
which groundfish to model. Annual diet estimates (based on sample sizes
of \textasciitilde{}100+ stomachs) are available for the top three
groundfish predators of herring (those with herring occurring in the
diets most often in the entire NEFSC food habits database): spiny
dogfish, Atlantic cod, and silver hake. Cod and spiny dogfish were
considered first because their overall diet proportions of herring are
higher, and because silver hake has the least recently updated
assessment. Diet compositions by year were estimated for spiny dogfish,
Georges Bank cod, and Gulf of Maine cod to match the scale of stock
assessments. Full weighted diet compositions were estimated, and suggest
considerable interannual variability in the herring proportion in
groundfish diets (filled blue proportions of bars in Fig.
\ref{gfishdiets}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{HerringTechnicalManu_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1} 

}

\caption{Annual diet compositions for major groundfish predators of herring estimated from NEFSC food habits database \label{gfishdiets}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-8}
\end{figure}

Some interannual variation in diet may be explained by changing herring
abundance. Dogfish and both cod stocks had positive relationships
between the amount of herring observed in annual diets and the size of
the herring population according to the most recent assessment
(statistics and plots available upon request). This suggests that these
groundfish predators are opportunistic, eating herring in proportion to
their availability in the ecosystem. However, monotonically declining
cod populations for both GOM and GB cod stocks resulted in either no
herring-cod relationship, or a negative relationship between herring
populations and cod populations (Fig. \ref{gfishBherrdiet}). Only
dogfish spawning stock biomass had a positive relationship with the
proporiton of herring in dogfish diet. Therefore, we selected dogfish as
the groundfish predator for modeling.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=400pt]{HerringTechnicalManu_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1} 

}

\caption{Relationship of assessed groundfish spawning stock biomass (SSB) with the proportion of herring in diet \label{gfishBherrdiet}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-9}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Dogfish population model}\label{dogfish-population-model}

The dogfish model stock recruitment function, initial population, and
annual natural mortality were adapted from information in (Rago et al.
1998, Rago and Sosebee 2010, 2013, Bubley et al. 2012). Due to
differential growth and fishing mortality by sex, our model best
represents female dogfish (a split-sex delay difference model was not
feasible within the time constraints of this MSE). Further, dogfish
stock-recruit modeling to date based on Ricker functions (Rago and
Sosebee 2010) captures more nuances in productivity than the
Beverton-Holt model we used. Our recruitment parameterization reflects a
stock with generally low productivity and relatively high resilience,
which we recognize is a rough approximation for a species such as
dogfish. The annual fishing exploitation rate applied is average of the
catch/adult female biomass from the most recent years of the 2016 data
update provided to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Rago
pers comm).

\subsubsection{Herring-dogfish relationship
model}\label{herring-dogfish-relationship-model}

There was a weak positive relationship between dogfish total biomass and
herring total biomass from the respective stock assessments (Fig.
\ref{pupherring}), but no clear relationship between dogfish weight or
dogfish recruitment and herring population size. During the recent
period of relatively low dogfish recruitment (1995-2007), there is a
positive relationship between dogfish pup average weight and herring
proportion in diet, suggesting a potential growth and or recruitment
mechanism; however this relationship does not hold throughout the time
series (Fig. \ref{pupherring}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{HerringTechnicalManu_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1} \includegraphics[width=.49\linewidth]{HerringTechnicalManu_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-2} 

}

\caption{Dogfish population relationships with herring total biomass (left) and herring proportion in diet (right) \label{pupherring}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-10}
\end{figure}

Therefore, to simulate a potential positive relationship between herring
and dogfish, we assumed that dogfish survival increased (natural
mortality was reduced) by an unspecified mechanism as herring abundance
increased (Fig. \ref{herringdogfish}). Because dogfish are fully
exploited by fisheries in this model, the impact of this change in
natural mortality on total survival has small to moderate benefits to
dogfish population numbers and biomass. Using a \(\delta\) = 0.2 in
equation \ref{varmort_equation} results in weak increases in dogfish
biomass with herring abundance consistent with observations.

\caption{Modeled herring relative population size-dogfish natural mortality relationship \label{herringdogfish}}\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-11}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Marine mammals}\label{marine-mammals}

Because no specific marine mammal was identified as a representative
herring predator in the stakeholder workshop, as with groundfish, the
first decision was which marine mammal to model. Diet information for a
wide range of marine mammals on the Northeast US shelf suggests that
minke whales, humpback whales, harbor seals, and harbor porpoises have
the highest proportions of herring in their diets (Smith et al. 2015),
and therefore may show some reaction to changes in the herring ABC
control rule.

While some food habits data existed for marine mammals, consultation
with marine mammal stock assessment scientists at the Northeast
Fisheries Science Center confirmed that no data were available to
parameterize a stock-recruitment relationship for any of these marine
mammal species in the Northeast US region, and no such information was
available in the literature for stocks in this region. Althouth it may
be possible to develop stock-recruitment models for one or more of these
species in the future, it was not possible within the time frame of the
herring MSE. Therefore, we were unable to model marine mammals within
the same framework as other predators.

Potential effects of changes in herring production and/or biomass on
marine mammals were instead evaluated using an updated version of an
existing food web model for the Gulf of Maine (Link et al. 2006, 2008,
2009) and incorporating food web model parameter uncertainty. Overall,
food web modeling showed that a simulated increase in herring production
in the Gulf of Maine may produce modest but uncertain benefits to marine
mammal predators, primarily because increased herring was associated
with decreases in other forage groups also preyed on by marine mammals.

\textbf{An Economic Model of the Predators}

We didn't do one.

\textbf{An Economic Model of the Herring Fishery}

\emph{Basics and Intro--} There are many economic methods that can
inform ecosystem approaches to fisheries management\footnote{Edwards et
  al. (2004) and Jin et al. (2016) illustrate a portfolio approach. Jin
  et al. (2003) and Jin et al. (2012) link regional economic models to
  ecosystem models. Tschirhart (2000) and Finnoff and Tschirhart (2003)
  link structural economic models of constrained optimization to
  ecosystem models.}. Kirkley et al. (2011) use a static input-output
model to simulate the effects of changes in herring quotas and predator
biomass levels on the New England economy. Their analysis suggested that
the effects of changes in herring catch on other segments of the economy
are quite small; we, therefore therefore confined the analysis to the
herring fleet. Lehuta et al. (2013) also construct an coupled
ecological-economic model of herring under the assumption of competitive
output markets for herring and zero economic profit. We did not make
this assumption.

The economic model of the herring fishery converts Yield from the
herring component into Gross Revenues (GR) and Net Operating Revenues
(NR). There are two fleets,trawl and purse seine, that are assumed to
have the ability to catch 70 and 30\% of the Yield
respectively\footnote{The midwater trawl, paired midwater trawl, and
  bottom trawl are all aggregated into the trawl fleet.}\footnote{The
  fishery is managed with four sub-ACLs and the purse seine fleet can
  only fish in one of the four areas. This 70/30 split corresponds to
  recent history.}. Gross Revenue, Net Revenue, and the constraints on
harvest can be represented as (for all years, \(y\) subscripts omitted
here for simplicity):

\begin{align}
GR^i&=p(q^t+q^s)q^i\\
NR^i&=GR-c^i(q^i)\\
q^s &\leq .3Q, \hspace{1mm} q^t \leq .7Q
\end{align}

where \(q^i\) and \(c^i\) are are the quantity landed and cost function
for fleet \(i\). We make two further assumptions: that total catch is
less than or equal to Yield \(q^t+q^s \leq Q\) and that a fleet has the
option of not fishing if positive harvest would lead to negative net
revenue (\(NR_i \geq 0\)). Each fleet selects \(q^i\) to maximize Net
Revenues under the relevant constraints.\\

\begin{equation}
\label{optimization_problem}
\max_{q_i} p(q^t+q^s)q^i - c^i(q^i)
\end{equation}

Note that, depending on prices and costs, a fleet may harvest nothing,
it's entire ``allocation'', or some level in between.

\emph{Production and Costs--} Economic data collected from 2010-2015 by
the Northest Fisheries Observer Program (NEFOP) are used to construct
average daily costs for the trawl and purse seine fleets. Fuel prices
were much higher in 2011-2014 compared to 2015. We construct a high and
a low fuel price scenario by adjusting these costs using the 2011-2014
average (high) or 2015 (low) prices for fuel based on EIA data. Other
costs of fishing included water, oil, and damage costs. Crew pay was not
included. Fuel expenses are a large portion of total expenses.

We construct average catch per day fished for each fleet from the Vessel
Trip Report databases over the same time period. The trip lengths in the
VTR and observer data were very similar. This allows us to construct the
average cost of catching a metric ton of herring for the trawl and purse
seine fleet (\(c^t\) and \(c^s\) respectively). We assume that the
average cost is equal to the marginal cost for each fleet. These figures
are presented in Table \ref{PUR_costs} and \ref{OTM_costs}.

\emph{Prices--} Annual prices were constructed from NMFS dealer data for
1982 through 2016\footnote{Prices have been normalized to 2015 real
  dollars using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price
  Index (PPI) for Unprocessed and Packaged Fish (WPU0223)}. Annual
landings were constructed from the processed ME DMR landings dataset for
the same time period. Because Atlantic Herring was not federally managed
prior to the implementation of the Herring FMP in 2000; the NMFS dealer
databases may not contain all landings. The ME DMR data do not contain
prices. Exploratory data analysis showed that prices, landings,and the
natural logarithms of both were likely non-stationary over the time
series. First-differencing produced stationary series. There also appear
to be two regimes in this market: one from 1982 to about 1993-1995 and
another from that time through 2016.

We used the Bounds test methodology developed by Pesaran et al. (2001)
test for a long-run relationship between prices and quantities. The
advantage of this method is that knowledge of stationarity is not
required for a valid test of a long-run relationship. A long-run
relationship between prices and landings can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\label{ARDL}
p_{y}= c+\sum_{i=1}^p a_i p_{t-i}+ \sum_{i=0}^n b_i q_{y-i} + e_{t},
\end{equation}

and rearranged into an error correction model (ECM):

\begin{equation}
\label{ECM}
\Delta p_y= \gamma+ \alpha_1 p_{y-1} + \sum_{i=1}^p \theta_i \Delta p_{y-i}+ \sum_{i=0}^n  \beta_i \Delta q_{y-i} + e_{y},
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta\) is the first-differences operator (Pesaran et al.
2001). The \(\gamma\) parameter must also be restricted
(\(\gamma=c / \alpha_1\)) for these equations \ref{ARDL} and \ref{ECM}
to be equivalent. The Pesaran et al. (2001) bounds test estimates
equation \ref{ECM} by OLS and constructs a joint-F test that the
\(\alpha_1\) and \(\beta_i\) parameters are non-zero. The F-statistic
has a non-standard distribution with an inconclusive area. The model was
first estimated on the full 1982-2015 dataset; model selection criteria
indicated a ARDL(4,0) was preferred and that prices were not affected by
quantities. This is likely caused by a combination of overfitting of the
model and the two regimes evident in exploratory graphs. An ARDL(1,0) is
then estimated on a subset of the data (1995-2015); if there was a
regime shift, the current regime is more likely to be similar to the
future. Models estimated in natural logarithms and in levels fit well.
The PSS F-statistics of 9.34 and 10.20 are above the upper critical
value, strongly suggesting a long-run relationship between prices and
quantities\footnote{As a robustness check, we tried varying the first
  (1996) and last (2016) year included in the dataset. This did not
  change the estimated results substantially. We also estimated a
  short-run relationship between prices and quantities in which
  \(\Delta p_y\) was regressed on \(\Delta q_y\). The short-run effects
  were qualitatively similar to the ``long-run'' model in Table
  \ref{ardl_regression}.} (Table \ref{ardl_regression}). We present the
results of the ARDL(1,0) formulation because it is a bit easier to
interpret.

\emph{Net Operating Revenues--} Because the marginal costs for the purse
seine are always less than the marginal costs of the trawl fisher, there
are three possible combinations of activity levels: both fleets active,
both inactive, and trawl inactive while purse seine is active.

Case 1 occurs if the output prices are very low. For some low level of
prices, only the purse seine fleet is active. When that happens, the net
revenue of the seine fleet is:

\begin{equation}
NR^s=p(q^s+0)q^s -c^sq^s=0
\end{equation}

\iffalse  Subsequent equation appears out of nowhere. \fi

\begin{equation}
\label{all_price}
p=\alpha + \beta_1 p_{y-1} + \gamma_0(\bar{q_{s}}+\bar{q_{s}}) )
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{all_price} is the price at which the entire quota is
harvested. For prices slightly lower than this, the trawl fleet harvests
less than its maximum fraction of yield. For prices lower than \$63.24,
the trawl fleet harvests nothing. There is also a range of output prices
below which the seine fishery harvests less than its share, and an even
lower price (\$14.27 per metric ton) at which the seine fishery is
inactive. These are the marginal costs of landing herring (Table
\ref{PUR_costs} and \ref{OTM_costs}).

\emph{Stability --}

Stakeholders were interested in understanding stability of the herring
industry. Following the herring dynamics section, we also computed
Interannual Variation (IAV) of Net Revenues and report the median
(across replicates) of median (across the final 50 years) of IAV. IAV is
a summary metric of variability in the time series over a time period,
but does not provide insight into stationarity of the time series.

An additional performance metric, stationarity, is used to assess the
stability of net revenues over the terminal period. For each simulation,
we perform an econometric test of stationarity (Dickey and Fuller 1979).
Letting \(\Delta\) be the first difference operator
(\(\Delta NR_y= NR_{y}-NR_{y-1}\)), the general form of the augmented
dickey fuller regression is:

\begin{equation}
\Delta NR_{y} = a_0 + \beta  NR_{y-1} + \delta y + \sum_{j=1}^k \xi_j \Delta NR_{y-j} + \varepsilon \label{dfuller_equation}
\end{equation}

Econometric evidence that \(\beta=0\) is evidence of a unit root
(nonstationarity) while statistical rejections of \(H_0: \beta=0\) in
favor of \(H_A: \beta<0\) is evidence of stationarity of the
time-series. We estimate a version of equation {[}dfuller\_equation{]}
in which \(a, \delta,\) and \(\xi_{j} \hspace{3mm} \forall j \ge 1\) are
restricted to zero:

\begin{equation}
\label{estimated}
\Delta NR_{y} = \beta  NR_{y-1} \xi_1 \Delta NR_{y-1} + \varepsilon 
\end{equation}

The results of these tests are summarized in two ways. First, we
classify a simulation as stationary if we reject the null
\(H_0: \beta=0\) in favor of \(H_A: \beta<0\) at the 10\% significance
level. We then compute the number of simulations (out of 100) that are
stationary. This classification may be too knife-edged. Many methods
have been used in the fields of meta-analysis and bioinformatic to
combine the results of independent experiments (Folks 1984, Rice 1990,
Whitlock 2005). Therefore, use a weighted Z-score method to combine
these trials (Whitlock 2005). To be concrete, the null hypothesis being
tested is the joint test that a particular control rule implemented on a
simulated stock of herring does not produce a stable
equilibrium{[}\^{}6{]}. Defining \(\phi\) as the standard normal
cumulative distribution function, we construct:

\begin{align}
Z_i &= \phi^{-1} (1-p_i)\\
Z  &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k Z_i}{\sqrt(k)}\end{align}

\(Z\) has a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis;
finding \(Z\) outside the standard normal is evidence to reject the null
hypothesis that a particular control rule leads to non-stationary
trajectory of revenue.

\iffalse
I also applied Fisher's method:

\begin{align}
\chi^2_F =-2\sum_{i=1}^k ln(P_i),
\end{align}

all of the null hypotheses of the \(k\) tests are true, then this will
have a \(\chi^2\) distribution with \(2k\) degrees of freedom. A value
would near zero would be evidence \emph{for} the null hypothesis of
non-stationarity. \fi

\emph{Caveats to the Herring Fishery Economic model--} We did not
include fixed costs. If firms do not enter or exit, then the exclusion
of fixed costs from the model has minimal qualitative effects. The
stationarity metric would be unaffected; however, IAV constructed
without fixed costs will be smaller than the true IAV that contains
fixed costs. A bigger problem is that, in the long run, firms can enter
and exit this industry. We assume that average variable costs are the
same as the marginal costs. This may be okay. It may be bad.

If firms can enter and exit, then exclusion of fixed costs from the
model could result in misleading recommendations. We did not model firm
entry and exit; this is a difficult decision to model. Economic theory
suggests that firms will enter (exit) if they anticipate large positive
(negative) profits over a particular planning horizon; however,
understanding exactly how these decisions are made was not possible.

Catch in the economic model can be different from the Yield (from the
herring model). This is frequently handled as symmetric implimentation
error in the fisheries literature (as it is in this model). However, the
market model suggests that this is not so simple.

Nothing big with Menhaden. Nothing on Lobster.

\iffalse  Two economic models were recently developed that focused on
herring in the Northeast United States. , through the intermediary of
the extractive herring sector. The authors take an optimization
approach: herring landings are selected to maximize output.

There are two drawbacks to this approach. First, because the model is
static, the effects of changes in commercial herring removals on
predators (through changes in herring biomass) cannot be deduced. The
dynamic ecosystem models developed address this particular shortcoming.
Second, constant prices for herring are assumed; this assumption is
relaxed as well. \%THIS IS Neither approaches examine the value of
increased herring biomass on other fisheries STUFF FROM THE KIRKLEY AND
LEHUTA CITATIONS

With multiple predators, prey, and variability in the desirability of
predators, it is possible that increases in biomass of a particular prey
could be bad for society. For example, biomass of a predator that is
low-valued but skilled at consuming herring could result in
disproportionate increases in that low-valued predator. If that
low-valued predator is not a complete specialist (in consuming herring),
it may also drive down the biomass of high-valued predators.

Stated another way, the ability to manipulate the ecosystem with an ABC
control rule to achieve desirable outcomes would depend on the rates at
which these increases in prey are converted into social utility: this
depends on the ecosystem technology (conversion of prey into additional
biomass of high- and low-valued predators), human technology (conversion
of prey and predator biomass into catch or tourism), and human
preferences (converting catch or tourism into utility). Despite our
current efforts, many of these technologies are not particularly well
understood at this time.

Herring is often (but no exclusively) used for bait; typically for the
lobster fishery. In 2014, approximately 75\% of landed herring was
utilized as bait. Other uses include animal food and human consumption.
On an annual basis, the quantity supplied in the herring market is
usually driven by the Annual Catch Limits (ACLs), or sub-ACLs. These are
occasionally not constraining; however seems to occur for regulatory
reasons (such as a closure for catch of haddock in the Georges Bank
fishery) instead of for market reasons. \fi

\emph{Random thoughts. this probably belongs in the non-tech manuscript
--} A key factor in management performance is the process by which
management tools are developed and implemented.

\begin{quote}
One approach to the creation of regulatory legitimacy is to structure
the management process around user participation in decision-making.
User participation addresses the twin problems of integrating human and
ecological systems and bringing individual users into the definition of
the collective good. Participation offers certain benefits to the
management process but it also carries costs. Whether it is worthwhile
for fishery management depends on the relative magnitudes of those
benefits and costs. (Hanna 1995)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
What we ask of fishery governance is that it coordinate institutional
rules and individual actions by performing certain functions:
incorporate multiple objectives representing different types of
conservation and use; bring the time horizons of private individuals
into line with those of the public; send signals of resource scarcity
and enable effective adaptive responses; promote legitimacy by
reflecting accepted norms of equity and by controlling harmful
opportunism; contain both the level and distribution of transactions
costs.These functions are expressions of Williamson's organizational
imperative to minimize costs, accommodate limited information, and
safeguard against harmful opportunism. (Hanna 1999)
\end{quote}

Fishery management must, among other things, incorporate multiple
objectives, promote legitimacy by reflecting accepted norms, and have
low transactions costs (Hanna 1999). User participation in
decision-making is a way to increase regulatory legitimacy (Hanna 1995).
One drawback to user-participation is that meetings tend to attract
participants with the most extreme views (Osborne et al. 2000, Turner
and Weninger 2005).

\subsection{Extensions, and Future
Research}\label{extensions-and-future-research}

Carroll et al. (2001) describe another mechanism (product quality)
through which changes in prey could be evaluated. We did not attempt to
value \emph{in-situ} herring or compute the social benefits or costs
derived from changes in biomass. Brown et al. (2005) and Finnoff and
Tschirhart (2003) describe methods to trace the effects of changes in
harvest or biomass of one species on ecosystems or predators. Finally,
we note that increases in predator biomass can have negative impacts on
prey and harvesters of prey Flaaten and Stollery (1996).

One of the difficulties with doing an economic extension that models the
prey species is that it's difficult to know which margin (dimension) to
address. For example, we didn't know that the tuna model would result in
changes in quality. If we had try to model how changes in abundance
might affect costs of harvesting tuna, this would have not been a
fruitful use of time. \clearpage
